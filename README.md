This is a site where a user can find many different venues which you can book as a user. Or you can log in as a venue manager where you can create your own venue, delete it or edit it as you want.

## Description

This site is a site for people who want to find different venues which they can book for holiday. The user can register and login as a customer, and with that, you can book dates at venues. But if the user register and login as a venue manager, then they can create their venue, delete their venues and also edit their venues.
